This is a school project for Comp 4312 Cloud Computing. 
This is a prototype of the webpage for a game that we will be building for our project.


The project will include features such as...
 - High scores which are stored in the cloud containing player name, score and ship type.

- Multiplayer in real time using the cloud to continually send information back and forth between the server and the client. Text chat will be included.

- For scalability, players will be split into 'rooms' if there are too many people playing at once. This is to prevent the game area from being too overcrowded and to reduce stress on the player's client.

- Players will be able to create and join groups with friends in order to play together.</p>
